    <h1>There are three states of being.Not knowing, action and completion.</h1>
    <h2>Accept that everything is a draft.It helps to get done.</h2>
    <h3>There is no editing stage.</h3>
    <strong>Pretending you know what you’re doing
      is almost the same as knowing what you
      what you’re doing even if you don’t
      and do it.</strong>
    <em>Banish procrastination. If you wait more
    than a week to get an idea done, abandon it.</em>
<ol>
<li>The point of being done is not to finish but
to get other things done.</li>
<li>Once you’re done you can throw it away.</li>
<br>
<li>Laugh at perfection. It’s boring and keeps
you from being done. </li>
<li>People without dirty hands are wrong.
Doing something makes you right.</li>
<br>
</ol>
<strong>Failure counts as done. So do mistakes.</strong>
<strong>Destruction is a variant of done. </strong>
<em>If you have an idea and publish it on the
internet, that counts as a ghost of done.</em>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Done is the engine of more.
